The real-time bidding (RTB) is vastly growing industry
in online advertising where complex and comprehensive
algorithms are being utilised to automatically buy and
sell the ads to individual users according to their data. 
This article would analyse technique,
algorithms and apply it an altered version of real dataset
released by iPinYou. It is suggested that RTB in the
United States during 2013 counted for 19% of the total
spending in display advertising.
Online advertising is growing fast, and RTB is expected
to grow signiSicantly. Currently, RTB standard CTR is
approximately 0.01% and requires tremendous
improvemen. The objective of this
report is to evaluate the various techniques and
methodologies for the individual part of this coursework
that includes (1) Data Exploration (2) Best Bidding
Strategy. The report will be based on real-time bidding
strategies, exploration and evaluation of dataset
provided by an organisation called iPinYou. The report
will include how the model being trained evolved its
performance. Four dataset Siles will be utilised in order
to successfully train the model which include train.csv,
test.csv and validation.csv.
By training the model, the developed model will evaluate
the Click-through rate achieved on the provided dataset.
The advertisers carry out an RTB activity through an
advertiser exchange to get their adverts displayed on
web pages effectively to achieve an impression (an
impression is when an advertisement is displayed on a
webpage). The end aim of this project is to develop a
bidding strategy using the dataset provided which will
output best click-through rate.
